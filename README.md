# JoinElimination

This repository contains info about a Bachelors Thesis experiment that studies the capability of performing table elimination transformation and the average query execution times, while also attempting to find correlations between operation speed and data volumes, of some of the most popular SQL database management systems. DBMS tested were PostgreSQL16, Orace23c Free, MySQL 8.3, MariaDB 11,4, MS SQL Server 2022 Developer, and DB2 11.5.

Each DBMS folder contains two database models with setup queries and queries that test join elimination based on these database models.
